# tls_socket_chat_webapp
## An extremely basic tls socket chat webapp. Uses node.js tls class and socket class. 
## This won't work if you clone it.. you have to create your own keys, certificates, etc.

Todo:
* Fix issue that sends client-entered-data to client process.stdout twice.
* Add connection error-handling.
