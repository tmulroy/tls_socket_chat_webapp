# TLS Socket Chat
## Uses node.js tls class and socket class. 

This won't work if you clone it.. you have to create your own keys, certificates, etc. Will post instructions on how to do that later.

Todo:
* Fix issue that sends client-entered-data to client process.stdout twice.
* Add connection error-handling.
* Add process.stdin prompts (ie "Server: ", "Client: ")
